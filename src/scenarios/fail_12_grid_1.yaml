# Grid-based configuration with goals and collection points at grid intersections
# Uses the same obstacle layout as config_2 (3x2 grid of 4x4 squares + 3 diamonds)
# Grid spacing: 6 units between obstacle centers
# Goals placed in corridors between obstacles
# Collection points at accessible grid intersections
